# Number-Guessing-Game

# 1: Description
This is a simple number-guessing game, where the user will have to guess a number between 1 and 100. The game can reset when the user guesses the correct number or runs out of attempts. 

# 1.1: What I learned
Throughout this project, I learned many things, including: 

- How to use functions
- Global variables
- How to use the multi-file system to work more efficiently
- How to understand buffer clearing more deeply
- How to make the DEBUG function using the #define function
- How to properly call functions

# 2: Features
My simple number guessing game features several enhancements to ensure it functions properly and provides an improved user experience. Some of the features are: 
- Robust error detection that can detect characters and integers over 100 or under 1
- Too high/low feedback on user input, to make it easier to guess the correct number with only 5 attempts
- Game restarting, with a new number generated after attempts run out/user guesses correct numbers
- DEBUG mode for easy testing
- Number generation between 1 and 100
- Error detection for numbers and characters for the restarting input
